replicate api for easily generating tex documents

Love the look of TeX but hat working with it? So do I. This api is intended to be an easy way to generate TeX documents and pdfs using nothing but plain text. You don't need anything more than notepad to generate cleanly formatted written reports. Not intended for advanced uses, not inclusive of most features of tex but it will output both a pdf document and a TeX document if you want to edit it further.
